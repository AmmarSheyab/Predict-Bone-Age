Pediatric Bone Age Assessment Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Bone and skeletal age assessment is a common clinical practice to check the effectiveness of treatment for diagnosed endocrine abnormalities in a child's development. It aims to assist physicians in improving the accuracy of diagnosis and patient care. In this project a fully automated deep learning approach to the bone age assessment problem is described using data from the 2017 Pediatric Bone Age Challenge organized by the Radiological Society of North American. [3]
 The data set for this competition consists of 12,600 radiographs. Although many bones have been studied to better determine bone age, X-rays of the left hand and wrist are the most frequently used images. Deep learning-based methods have shown performance improvements compared to traditional machine learning methods for many problems. CNN has been used successfully. This approach allows us to measure the importance of specific hand bones for automated bone age analysis.
# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Deep Learning – which has emerged as an effective tool for analyzing big data – uses complex algorithms and artificial neural networks to train machines/computers so that they can learn from experience, classify and recognize data/images just like a human brain does. Within Deep Learning, a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a type of artificial neural network, which is widely used for image/object recognition and classification. Deep Learning thus recognizes objects in an image by using a CNN.
# Description
The aim of this project is to predict Bone Age (in months) from the X-Ray and Gender.

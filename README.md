Pediatric Bone Age Assessment Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
#Introduction
Bone and skeletal age assessment is a common clinical practice to check the effectiveness of treatment for diagnosed endocrine abnormalities in a child's development. It aims to assist physicians in improving the accuracy of diagnosis and patient care. In this project a fully automated deep learning approach to the bone age assessment problem is described using data from the 2017 Pediatric Bone Age Challenge organized by the Radiological Society of North American.

 The data set for this competition consists of 12,600 radiographs. Although many bones have been studied to better determine bone age, X-rays of the left hand and wrist are the most frequently used images. Deep learning-based methods have shown performance improvements compared to traditional machine learning methods for many problems. CNN has been used successfully. This approach allows us to measure the importance of specific hand bones for automated bone age analysis.
